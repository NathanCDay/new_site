## Crime Data Dive

## Why drug crime? {.build}

- Cooler than parking tickets
- Access to ~31,000 observations, over 5 years!
- Have you seen The Wire?

![](the_wire.gif)

## Goals of this talk {.build}

- Show distribution of crime in our city
- Provide an template for analyzing more data
- Get people excited about using R

![](excited.gif)

## Data Process {.build}

1. Open Data Portal - Crime Reports
2. Geocode via Google Map API
3. Use `library(sf) %>% tidyverse` for spatial data exploration
4. Model and test patterns with `library(spdep)` and `glm()`

```{r libs, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(geojsonio) # get ODP data
library(sf) # the new spatial kid
library(spdep) # the spatial grandaddy
library(broom) # extract model info easy
library(magrittr) # %<>% life
library(tidyverse) # duh
```

## Where is crime happening? {.build}

```{r crime_map, echo=FALSE}
my_github <- "https://github.com/NathanCDay/cville_crime/raw/master/data/"
crime_counts <- readRDS(gzcon(url(paste0(my_github,"crime_counts_sf.RDS"))))
census <- readRDS(gzcon(url(paste0(my_github,"census_sf.RDS"))))

ggplot(crime_counts) +
    geom_sf(data = census) +
    geom_sf(aes(size = n, color = n, alpha = n)) +
    scale_color_viridis_c() +
    facet_wrap(~drug_flag) 

crime_counts %<>% st_set_geometry(NULL)
```


## Most frequent addresses {.smaller .build}
Top 3 address for drug crime and not drug crime
```{r most_frequent, echo = T}
arrange(crime_counts, -n) %>% group_by(drug_flag) %>% slice(1:3)
```

The police station's address is 606 E Market Street....

## What is going on at the police station? {.smaller .build}

"The answer is quite simple - when individuals walk in to the police department to file a report the physical address of the department (606 E Market Street) is often used in that initial report if no other known address is available at the time. This is especially true for incidents of found or lost property near the downtown mall where there is no true known incident location. The same is true for any warrant services that result in a police report occurring at the police department." - CPD

## Test if proportions are different {.smaller .build}

```{r police_station_proportions, echo = TRUE}
station_props <- arrange(crime_counts, -n) %>%
    group_by(drug_flag) %>%
    add_count(wt = n, name = "nn") %>%
    slice(1)

with(station_props, prop.test(n, nn)) %>% tidy
```

No, they are not.

## Aggregate into areas {.smaller .build}

Census blocks make a lot of sense because:

+ Tons of data in Census and American Community Surveys
+ Reputable source with code books and APIs
+ Easy to access in R via ODP and `library(tidycensus)`

![](do_it.gif)

## Start to do it {.smaller .build}
```{r census_pop, echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=4, cache = TRUE}
long_url <- "https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/e60c072dbb734454a849d21d3814cc5a_14.geojson"
census <- geojsonio::geojson_read(long_url, what = "sp") %>%
    st_as_sf()

ggplot(census, aes(fill = HU_Vacant / Housing_Units)) + # fill with whatever you want
  geom_sf() +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() # aww yess
```

## Keep doing it {.smaller .build}

+ Start with geocoded version
```{r raw_geo, message=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
crime <- read_csv("https://github.com/NathanCDay/cville_crime/raw/master/crime_geocode.csv")
crime %<>% filter(complete.cases(.))
crime %<>% filter(address != "600 E MARKET ST Charlottesville VA")
```

+ Convert to `sf`, with same Coordinate Reference System (critical)
```{r crime_sf, echo = TRUE}
crime %<>% st_as_sf(coords = c("lon", "lat"), crs = st_crs(census))
```

+ Use `sf::st_within()` and friends
```{r st_within, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
crime %<>% mutate(within = st_within(crime, census) %>% as.numeric) %>% 
    filter(!is.na(within))
```

There are bunch of other great `st_x(sf_a, sf_b)` functions too. If you want to do it, there's a tool for it.

## Done with it {.smaller .build}

+ Flag by interest
```{r drug_flag, echo = TRUE}
crime %<>% mutate(drug_flag = ifelse(grepl("drug", Offense, ignore.case = TRUE),
                                     "drugs", "not_drugs"))
```

+ Summarise with `tidyverse`

```{r tidy_sum, echo = TRUE}
crime_block <- st_set_geometry(crime, NULL) %>% # remove geometry for spread() to work
    group_by(within, drug_flag) %>%
    count() %>%
    spread(drug_flag, n) %>%
    mutate(frac_drugs = drugs / sum(drugs + not_drugs)) %>%
    ungroup() # geom_sf doesn't care for grouped dfs/tbls
```

+ Join in
```{r, echo = TRUE}
census %<>% inner_join(crime_block, by = c("OBJECTID" = "within"))
```

## Hot blocks {.smaller}

```{r, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(census, aes(fill = frac_drugs)) +
    geom_sf() + scale_fill_viridis_c()
```

## Is it random? {.smaller}

Test with Moran's I statistic

```{r, fig.height = 3}
census_sp <- as(census, "Spatial")
block_wnb <- poly2nb(census_sp) %>% nb2listw
moran.mc(census_sp$frac_drugs, block_wnb, nsim = 999) %>% tidy
```

Are there other community metrics that are correlated?


## Get more data {.smaller}
Median `income` data comes from the American Community Survey via `library(tidycensus)` to supplement housing and demographics from the original Census data from ODP.

```{r model_vars, echo=F, fig.height = 4, warning =F, message = F}
cvl <- tidycensus::get_acs(geography = "block group", county = "Charlottesville", state = "VA",
               variables = c("B19013_001") )

decode <- c("income") %>% set_names(c("B19013_001"))
cvl$variable %<>% decode[.]

cvl %<>% select(GEOID, variable, estimate) %>%
    spread(variable, estimate)

# ggplot(cvl, aes(age, income)) +
#     geom_point()
# missing values
# let's impute them by neighbors

cvl %<>% rename(BlockGroup = GEOID)

census %<>% full_join(cvl)

# sequester the missing values value
miss <- census %>% filter(is.na(income))

# calculate the mean its neightbors
miss$income <- st_touches(miss, census) %>% # return the row_ids for adjacent polygons
    map_dbl(~ census[., ] %>% with(mean(income))) # calculate the means per missing block

# builder decoder
dc <- miss$income %>% set_names(miss$OBJECTID) 
    
# back together again
census %<>% mutate(income = ifelse(is.na(income), dc[as.character(OBJECTID)], income))

census %<>% mutate(frac_black = Black / Population,
                   frac_vacant = HU_Vacant / Housing_Units)


# pred column positions for ggpairs()
pred_cols <- match(c("frac_drugs", "frac_vacant", "income", "frac_black"), names(census))

# bugg in GGally with new ggplot2::aes()
# library(GGally)
# ggpairs(census, columns = pred_cols)

```

## Which predictors are significant? {.smaller .build}

+ Use a `glm()` to fit the highly correlated predictors simultaneously.

```{r mod_sum, echo = TRUE}
mod <- glm(frac_drugs ~ frac_black + income,
           data = census, family = quasibinomial())
```

+ Indentify the relationships that matter

```{r}
summary(mod) %>% coefficients()
```

The proportion of the population that is black is significant, but median income is not.

+ A good model should have randomly dispersed residuals.

```{r}
moran.mc(resid(mod), block_wnb, nsim = 999) %>% tidy
```

## Wrap up

Does drug enforcement target black communities?

More steps:

+ Get data about police patrol locations/frquency

+ Dig deeper on the crime reporting procedure

+ How many of these "drug" crimes are low-level offenses

+ Add temporal elements to the model i.e. seasonal, time of day
