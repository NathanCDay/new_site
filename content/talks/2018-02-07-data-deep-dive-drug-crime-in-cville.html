<p>This talk was part of <a href="https://www.smartcville.com/">Smart Cville’s Data Deep Dive</a> series focusing on Charlottesville City’s new <a href="http://opendata.charlottesville.org/">Open Data Portal</a>.</p>
<p>The goals of this talk were to introduce the new <code>library(sf)</code> for spatial data manipulation and provide a tidyverse-centric template for other data analysts to use for exploring the public Charlottesville Police Department records. I built some code-along templates to make the talk less boring and more interactive, and those are in a <a href="https://github.com/NathanCDay/data_dive">public GitHub repo here</a>. If you want to revisit the slides I presented at the event, they are <a href="https://natedayta.com/slides/crime_deep_dive.html">hosted here on this site</a>.</p>
<p>Also since this project required some development version packages, which can be messy to install, Jeff Xing kindly <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/jfx319/datadive/">built a Docker image</a> that runs RStudio server and has all of the required libraries ready to go.</p>
